## Overview
This project analyzes the performance of a bicycle store from 2016 to 2018. It addresses 10 key business questions, and the findings will assist the business in making informed decisions for future development.

## Objectives
- Analyze annual and monthly sales, monthly cumulative sales, together with the growth rate.
- Identify revenue contributions and patterns such as state revenue contributions, peak sales months, and weekday sales patterns.
- Evaluate product performance by category, brand, product itself.
- Segment customers using RFM analysis.

## Tasks:
- Set up workspace: download CSV files and import to database that was created using Azure Data Studio.
- Read, explore to understand business problems, define objectives and key questions.
- Data cleaning include correct the data types, handle Null values/ duplicate values, delete unvaluable columns to ensure it's accurate and free of errors
- Data analysis: answer given business questions, optimize the codes to reduce the running time.
- Documentation: wrap up the project's objetives, observations and upload to Github's repository.

## Dataset

The data for this project is the sample data from SQL Server Tutorial

## Findings and Conclusion
- Sales Trends: Performance peaked in 2017, followed by a significant decline in 2018â€”indicating an overall downward trend.
- Market Leadership: New York accounted for about 65% of total revenue each year.
- Revenue Fluctuations: Revenue fell from $537,192 in April 2018 to $188.99 in June (due to closure in May) but rebounded to $9,484 in the next month.
- Sales Patterns: No consistent monthly bestsellers across states suggest sales are not seasonally dependent.
- Ordering Trends: In New York, orders peak on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Texas sees orders on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays. California shows no clear pattern.
- Product Categories: Cruisers are the top-selling bikes, making up 29% of total sales, with Electra as the most popular brand.
- Customer Breakdown: 44% of customers were regular, 20% were new, high-paying and regular customers comprised 11% and 12%, respectively, while the best customers contributed only 1% of sales.

### Recommendations:
- Analyze the factors behind the sales decline post-2017 and implement targeted marketing campaigns, especially in the lucrative New York market. 
- Improving inventory management and utilizing data analytics will help optimize stock levels and capitalize on peak ordering times.
- Developing customer loyalty programs, introducing seasonal promotions, diversifying the product range, and enhancing the online shopping experience can attract and retain customers. 
- Establishing a feedback loop and investing in staff training will further ensure a high-quality customer experience, for sustained growth and profitability.
